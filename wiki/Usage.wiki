#summary How to use yadmt

For classification, you would want to ask following questions:
 # For a given dataset, find the best classifier (in this section, the classifier refers to "classifier+parameter" combo, i.e. "svm_poly+degree2")
   * See section "How to find best classifier"
 # Given many datasets, find the best classifier on each datasets.
   * This is same as asking question 1 on every dataset, i.e. treating every dataset independent of each other. Good news is you don't have to run _yadmt_ for every single dataset. All you have to do is modify [http://code.google.com/p/yadmt/source/browse/trunk/src/getParameterName.sh getParameterName] file and add path of every dataset in files.txt and _yadmt_ will take care of the rest.
 # Given many datasets and just 1 classifier, compare the classifier's performance across the dataset.
   * Since not many researchers are interested in this question, this feature is hidden intentionally. Set "COMPARE_DATASETS=1" in [http://code.google.com/p/yadmt/source/browse/trunk/src/yadmt.sh yadmt] to enable this (Note: only for advanced users). 
 # Given many datasets and many classifiers, find the best classifier overall.
   * This is a tricky question and _yadmt_ doesnot answer that directly (although it does that indirectly by answering questions 2 and 3). We suggest that you run appropriate statistical tests on accuracy file and make your own decision (See [http://code.google.com/p/yadmt/source/browse/trunk/src/StatisticalTests.R StatisticalTests.R] for reference).
 # You have developed a new classifier ("control classifier") and you want to test its performance across traditional classifiers.
   * Feature under development.
